# OpenCV_Camera	  
Those py files use OpenCV to displace two or more cameras  with tkinter GUI.

There are two helper functions:  
 
GetCamIndex.py will use opencv to get the index and names of all the buil in and USB webcams.
GetVideoCaputure.py will use open one of the camera.

And the main functions:
 
CameraApp_tkinter_main.py will use tkinter to create a camera APP to show all the camera, the zoom and pan buttons will only work on cameras with digital zoom. 
 
And the option functions if you want to show the camera all at once or one at a time:
 
ShowAllCamsApps.py will show all the cameras on the GUI.	
SwithCamerasApp.py will only show on camera at a time.
